# VRP-Algorithms
A collection of solutions to variations of the vehicle routing problem.

Currently, there are implementations of the petal heuristics method (PetalHeuristics.py) and a method developed during my work at the UNT Computational Epidemiology Lab, dubbed the RSS Algorithm (OVRP-UT.py).

I am working on implementing the Branch and Bound method.
